## What?

Visit [BlackMyScreen.github.io](https://BlackMyScreen.github.io) to download a black background image for your phone, tablet or desktop.

Especially useful to save battery on OLED displays.

In addition it includes a colorful "I'm Feeling Lucky" background, go and try it out üòç

## How

I've used svelte to generate the js as I don't find other opportunities to use it and was too lazy for vanilla even though it was my first plan. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Images are being rendered via `<canvas/>` the page itself has no dependencies.

The "I'm Feeling Lucky" background comes almost straight from the Svelte tutorial on [Bindings/This](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this)

Update: The animation is now using a dedicated **WebWorker** üöÄ to calculate the next colors, which made the whole site much more responsive. Before that even hovering a link would take seconds before it changed its colors üò¨

## Why ask for money?

Even though it's completely free, didn't cost me any actual money and I made it for fun, I ask for support as I moved to Per√∫, founded a non-profit and am working full time in rainforest conservation to help sustain our planet. If you like what I do please consider donating any amount via one of the many options so I can continue my work & protect more rainforest.
